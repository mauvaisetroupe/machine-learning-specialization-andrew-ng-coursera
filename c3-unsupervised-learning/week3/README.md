# Reinforcement learning

This week, you will learn about reinforcement learning, and build a deep Q-learning neural network in order to land a virtual lunar lander on Mars!
What is Reinforcement Learning?

## What is Reinforcement learning ?

Reinforcement learning is not widely applied in commercial applications yet today, but is one of the pillars of machine learning. 
There are a lots of exciting research backing it up and improving it every single day.

When the helicopter is moving through the air, it's actually very difficult to get a data set of x and the ideal action y. 
So that's why for a lot of task of controlling a robot like a helicopter and other robots, the supervised learning approach doesn't work well and we instead use reinforcement learning. 

Instead, we use in reinforcement learning something called the reward or the reward function which tells the helicopter when it's doing well and when it's doing poorly 

Reward function is a bit like training a dog. Hopefully it learns by itself how to yhings, but you reward whan it do good things

Reinforcement learning is so powerful is you have to tell it **what to do** rather than **how to do it**.

Robot dog that using reinforcement learning, which rewards it when climbing over a variety of obstacles. I really don't know how to tell it what's the best way to place its legs to get over a given obstacle. All of these things were figured out automatically by the robot just by giving it rewards that incentivizes it, making progress toward the goal

## Mars rover example

We'll develop reinforcement learning using a simplified example inspired by the Mars rover

Formalism of how a reinforcement learning application works:
- current state S
- action a
- reward R(s)
- next state S'
