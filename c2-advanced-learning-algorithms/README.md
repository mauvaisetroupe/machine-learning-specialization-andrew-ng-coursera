In the second course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:

 - Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
 - Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world
 - Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees

It provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)

[Week 1 - Neural Networks](./week1/README.md)

This week, you'll learn about neural networks and how to use them for classification tasks. You'll use the TensorFlow framework to build a neural network with just a few lines of code. Then, dive deeper by learning how to code up your own neural network in Python, "from scratch". Optionally, you can learn more about how neural network computations are implemented efficiently using parallel processing (vectorization).

[Week 2 - Neural Networks Training](./week2/README.md)

This week, you'll learn how to train your model in TensorFlow, and also learn about other important activation functions (besides the sigmoid function), and where to use each type in a neural network. You'll also learn how to go beyond binary...
