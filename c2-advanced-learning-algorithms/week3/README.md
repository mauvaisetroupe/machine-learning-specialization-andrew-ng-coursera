# Advice for applying machine learning

This week you'll learn best practices for training and evaluating your learning algorithms to improve performance. This will cover a wide range of useful advice about the machine learning lifecycle, tuning your model, and also improving your training data.

## Deciding what to try next


"I've seen teams sometimes, say six months to build a machine learning system, that I think a more skilled team could have taken or done in just a couple of weeks." The efficiency of how quickly you can get a machine learning system to work well, will depend to a large part on how well you can repeatedly make good decisions

Diagnostics can take time to implement, but running them can be a very good use of your time
