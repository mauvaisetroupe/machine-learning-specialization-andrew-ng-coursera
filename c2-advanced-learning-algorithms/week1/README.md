# Neural Networks

This week, you'll learn about neural networks and how to use them for classification tasks. You'll use the TensorFlow framework to build a neural network with just a few lines of code. Then, dive deeper by learning how to code up your own neural...

## Neurons and the brain

All of human thought is from neurons like this in your brain and mine, sending electrical impulses and sometimes forming new connections of other neurons. Given a neuron like this one, it has a number of inputs where it receives electrical impulses from other neurons, and then carries out some computations and will then send this outputs to other neurons by this electrical impulses

Here's a simplified diagram of a biological neuron and comparison with software

Now, at this point, I'd like to give one big caveat, which is that even though I made a loose analogy between biological neurons and artificial neurons, I think that today we have almost no idea how the human brain works. In fact, every few years, neuroscientists make some fundamental breakthrough about how the brain works
